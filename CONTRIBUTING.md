# Contributing

Add one unique `.changelog/*.md` fragment for each observable change. With
PHP 8.5+ and CPX, inspect `help add`, then create and validate the note:

```sh
cpx --skip-local fast-forward/changelog add "Describe the observable change." --category=fixed --no-interaction
cpx --skip-local fast-forward/changelog check --no-interaction
```

After committing, validate the contribution with `check --since=origin/main`.
After `composer install`, read `.agents/skills/fast-forward-changelog/SKILL.md`
for the full procedure. Preserve published history and pending notes; do not add
an `Unreleased` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.

The GitHub workflow checks contributions, maintains PR feedback and prepares a
version PR. Review its exact changes before merging: that approved merge enables
automatic tag and GitHub Release publication. Installing the workflow publishes
nothing.

The development-only `llm/skills` Composer plugin restores the Changelog skill
from the reviewed GitHub source in `skills.json`; generated files are ignored by
Git. Use `composer skills:show` to inspect it and
`composer skills:update --from=github` for an explicit refresh within the
configured version range. Review `skills.json` before changing that range.

## Composer dependency skills

The development-only manager restores `fast-forward-container` and
`fast-forward-config` from the installed Composer packages, including Config as
a transitive dependency. `skills.json` explicitly trusts only those two Composer
donors; dependency trust does not extend to other installed packages. No separate
GitHub source or version pin is used for either library.

Inspect donors with `composer skills:show` and refresh their payloads with
`composer skills:update --from=composer`. The existing GitHub source continues
to manage the Changelog contributor skill independently. Generated copies remain
ignored. Synchronization does not upgrade runtime dependencies; an installed
version without a bundled skill contributes no skill. Check installed versions
and the bundled skill's supported contract before using its instructions.
